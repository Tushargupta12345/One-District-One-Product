# One-District One-Product Initiative

## Description
The One-District One-Product (ODOP) initiative aims to promote the unique products of each district, enhancing local economies and preserving cultural heritage. This project showcases these unique products through a user-friendly web application, allowing users to explore and learn about the rich diversity of products from different districts.

In our specific implementation of the ODOP project, the primary objective of the platform is to cut out intermediaries from the supply chain, enabling producers to receive fair remuneration for their products while giving consumers access to a diverse range of authentic ODOP items.
